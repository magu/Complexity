## Complexity

![Action shot](https://raw.github.com/magu/Complexity/master/releases/complexity.png)

Complexity is a quick and dirty mod of the Simplicity watch face for Pebble which adds Week Day and Week Number to the main screen.

The text for the top two rows is only redrawn if changed to conserve juice.

### Building the watch face

First, create a new project with the `create_pebble_project.py` script included in the [Pebble SDK](http://developer.getpebble.com).

    cd <parent dir of project root>

    /<sdk_path>/tools/create_pebble_project.py --symlink-only /<sdk_path>/sdk/ complexity

    cd complexity

    ./waf configure build

### Install the watch face using libpebble

First, make sure [libpebble](https://github.com/pebble/libpebble) is set up and running properly. Then:

    /<libpebble_path>/p.py --pebble_id <PEBBLE_ID_OR_MAC_ADDRESS> --lightblue load complexity.pbw
